**Part 1**

*Task A*

*Task B*

Given wigner function on phase space (x, y) (2D array) - sample points on unit circle and some points along the axes
find density matrix w/ least squares optimization under the constraint that Tr is constant

Optional: something besides least squares?

- Compare  using at least one additional method beyond fidelity.

*Task C*

This is very straightforward

Optional: check eigenvalue distributions, purity, or expected photon number. (one of these might be interesting)

**Part 2**

*Task A*

easy, just comes down to finding right parameter for Gaussian filter

*Task B*- Supervised Learning

*Task C*- Speedup of fitting function
